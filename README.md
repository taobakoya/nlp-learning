<b>NLP Tasks</b>
<p>
Several NLP tasks break down human text and voice data in ways that help the computer make sense of what it's ingesting. SOme of these tasks include the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Speech recognition, also called speech-to-text, is the task of reliavly converting voice data into text data.</li>
<li>Part of speech tagging, also called grammatical tagging, is the process of determining the part of speech of a particular words or piece of text based on its use and context.</li>
<li>Word sense disambiguation is the section of the meaning of a word with multiple meaning through a process of semantic analysis that determine the word that makes the most sense in the given context</li>
<li>Name entity recognition, or NEM, identifies words or phrases as usual entities</li>
<li>Sentiment analysis attempts to extract subjective qualities-attitudes,emotion,sarcasm,confusion, suspicion-form text.</li>
<li>Natural Language Generation is sometimes descriped as  the opposite of speech recognition of speech-to-text; its the task of putting structured information into human language.</li>
</ul>
